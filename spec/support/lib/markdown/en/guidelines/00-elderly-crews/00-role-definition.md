###### What elderly crews is all about.

Elderly crews are crucial parts of the Pandemic Volunteers team who go around to retirement homes and elderly individualsâ€™ homes to check up on them and bring them essential needs such as food and clothes so that they do not have to leave the home and risk catching COVID-19.

This is an especially important job because it targets the elderly, those who are at most risk of dying from or hurting themselves permanently if they do catch the virus, so volunteers are supposed to be even more careful than normal because of their added vulnerabilities. 

Volunteers must also know how to reach out to their local elderly individuals, how to sterilize groceries and PPE, nonviolent communication and have to avoid the most amount of contact possible. If one is interested in this position and does not think they have the required skills, they can always follow the following knowledgebase articles to learn more and hopefully be qualified enough to be able to carry out such a job efficiently, and, more importantly, safely.

Elderly crew volunteers have the choice of being assigned targets by Coordination Crew meetings, and joining an action crew to listen in and know what those targets are, or they can find targets individually and help those in need as soon as they know about them. 

They must also remember not to treat elderly individuals like children, or patronize them in any way: they may not be necessarily dependent on outside groups for support most of the time, and in a time of crisis such as this one it is only right that they do what is best for their health without any judgment.
